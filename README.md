# dice_game
Python script to implement a dice game for 2 to 4 players. Each player takes turns rolling a die. If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they score 0 points for that turn; otherwise, they accumulate points based on the value rolled. The game continues until one or more players reach a maximum score of 50 points.
